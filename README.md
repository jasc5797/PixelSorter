# PixelSorter
Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelsorting/

## Description
C# WinForms application that sorts the pixels in an image either horizontally by row or vertically by column. Includes options to sort by luminance, brightness, saturation, or hue of the pixels. This application sorts the rows or columns of the image in parallel to help speed up the process. 

#### Note:
Sorting by luminance or brightness will return very similair results.

## Todo
* Sort only a certain color range
* Sort at on any angle
* Add sorting by intervals instead of by whole image
